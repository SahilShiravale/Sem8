Detailed Explanation of Parallel Merge Sort Code
=============================================

This document provides a comprehensive explanation of a C++ program implementing a parallel merge sort algorithm using OpenMP. The explanation covers the code structure, functionality, output analysis, and key concepts to prepare for potential questions from an external examiner.

---

### Overview of the Code
The program implements merge sort in two variants:
1. **Sequential Merge Sort**: Used for small arrays or when parallelism is inefficient.
2. **Parallel Merge Sort**: Uses OpenMP to parallelize recursive divide-and-conquer steps for larger arrays.

**Program Functionality**:
- Accepts user input for array size and input method (random or manual).
- Sorts the array using parallel merge sort.
- Measures and displays execution time.
- Verifies if the array is sorted.
- Prints the sorted array (for small inputs) and time complexity.

### Key Components of the Code

#### 1. Libraries Used
- `<iostream>`: Input/output operations.
- `<omp.h>`: OpenMP directives for parallelism.
- `<vector>`: Dynamic array management.
- `<cstdlib>`: Random number generation (`rand`).
- `<ctime>`: Seeding random number generator.
- `<iomanip>`: Output formatting (e.g., fixed-point precision).
- `<limits>`: Input validation (e.g., clearing input buffer).
- `<chrono>`: High-resolution timing.

#### 2. Sequential Merge Sort (`mergeSortSequential`)
- **Purpose**: Sorts small subarrays sequentially to avoid parallelism overhead.
- **Mechanism**:
  - **Base Case**: If `left < right`, proceed with sorting.
  - **Divide**: Compute midpoint `mid = left + (right - left) / 2` to avoid integer overflow.
  - **Recurse**: Sort left half (`left` to `mid`) and right half (`mid + 1` to `right`).
  - **Merge**:
    - Copy left half to temporary array `temp`.
    - Compare elements from `temp` (left) and `arr` (right), merging in sorted order.
    - Copy remaining left-half elements, if any.
- **Why Temporary Array?** Ensures stable merging without overwriting original array.

#### 3. Parallel Merge Sort (`mergeSortParallel`)
- **Purpose**: Parallelizes recursive divide step using OpenMP tasks.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Threshold**: If subarray size ≤ 1000 or recursion depth ≥ 4, switch to sequential sort.
  - **OpenMP Directives**:
    - `#pragma omp task if(depth < max_depth)`: Creates tasks for left and right halves.
    - `#pragma omp taskwait`: Waits for both tasks to complete before merging.
  - **Merge**: Sequential, identical to sequential merge sort.
- **Why Limit Depth?** Prevents excessive task creation overhead.

#### 4. Input Validation (`getValidInteger`)
- **Purpose**: Ensures valid integer input within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 1,000,000 for array size).
- **Mechanism**: Prompts user, validates input, clears stream on invalid input, and retries.
- **Benefit**: Robust against non-integer or out-of-range inputs.

#### 5. Time Complexity Analysis (`printTimeComplexity`)
- **Sequential Merge Sort**: O(n log n) for all cases.
- **Parallel Merge Sort**:
  - Total work: O(n log n).
  - Wall-clock time: Ideally O((n log n)/p), where p is the number of processors.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for temporary array.

#### 6. Main Function
- **Steps**:
  1. Get array size using `getValidInteger`.
  2. Choose input method:
     - Random: Generate integers (0 to 99,999) using `rand()`.
     - Manual: Prompt for integers with validation.
  3. Perform parallel sorting:
     - Use `#pragma omp parallel` and `#pragma omp single` to initiate tasks.
     - Measure time using `<chrono>`.
  4. Output:
     - Execution time (6 decimal places).
     - Sorted array (if size ≤ 10).
     - Sorting verification.
     - Time complexity.

### Explanation of the Output
**Output Example**:
```
Enter the size of the array (1-1000000): 5
Generate random array (r) or manual input (m)? m
Enter 5 integers:
5
2
9
1
6
Parallel Merge Sort Time: 0.002983 seconds
Sorted array: [1, 2, 5, 6, 9]
Array is sorted

Time Complexity Analysis:
- Sequential Merge Sort: O(n log n) for all cases
- Parallel Merge Sort: O(n log n) total work, O((n log n)/p) wall-clock time
  where n is the array size and p is the number of processors
```

**Breakdown**:
1. **Input**:
   - Size: 5.
   - Method: Manual.
   - Integers: [5, 2, 9, 1, 6].
2. **Execution Time**: 0.002983 seconds (low due to small size and sequential sort).
3. **Sorted Array**: [1, 2, 5, 6, 9] (correctly sorted, printed since size ≤ 10).
4. **Verification**: Confirms array is sorted.
5. **Time Complexity**: Restates theoretical complexities.

**Why Low Time?** Size (5) < threshold (1000), so sequential merge sort is used.

### Step-by-Step Sorting (n = 5, Input: [5, 2, 9, 1, 6])
1. **Initial Call**: `mergeSortParallel(arr, 0, 4, temp, 0)`.
   - Size = 5 < 1000, so calls `mergeSortSequential(arr, 0, 4, temp)`.
2. **Sequential Merge Sort**:
   - Divide: Mid = 2.
     - Left: [5, 2, 9] (indices 0 to 2).
     - Right: [1, 6] (indices 3 to 4).
   - Left Recursion ([5, 2, 9]):
     - Divide: Mid = 1.
     - Left: [5, 2] → Sort: [2, 5].
     - Right: [9] (sorted).
     - Merge: [2, 5, 9].
   - Right Recursion ([1, 6]):
     - Divide: Mid = 3.
     - Left: [1] (sorted).
     - Right: [6] (sorted).
     - Merge: [1, 6].
   - Final Merge:
     - Left: [2, 5, 9], Right: [1, 6].
     - Merge: [1, 2, 5, 6, 9].
3. **Verification**: Array [1, 2, 5, 6, 9] is sorted.

### Key Concepts for Examiners
1. **Merge Sort**:
   - Stable, comparison-based, divide-and-conquer.
   - O(n log n) always.
2. **OpenMP**:
   - Simplifies parallelism with pragmas.
   - Tasks for independent recursive calls.
   - Synchronization with `taskwait`.
3. **Parallelism**:
   - Parallelizes recursive division.
   - Sequential merge for simplicity.
   - Threshold and depth limit balance overhead.
4. **Time Complexity**:
   - Sequential: O(n log n).
   - Parallel: O(n log n) work, O((n log n)/p) wall-clock.
   - Space: O(n).
5. **Threshold**: Avoids parallelism overhead for small arrays.
6. **Depth Limit**: Prevents excessive task creation.

   - Ensures stable merging without overwriting.
4. **Why low time for n = 5?**
   - Sequential sort used (size < threshold).
5. **Threshold impact?**
   - Balances parallelism and overhead; tunable.
6. **Increase max_depth?**
   - More parallelism but higher overhead.
7. **Stable algorithm?**
   - Yes, due to `<=` in merge.
8. **Limitations?**
   - Overhead, sequential merge, O(n) space, fixed threshold.
9. **Improvements?**
   - Dynamic threshold, parallel merge, load balancing, cache optimization.
10. **Why verify sorting?**
    - Ensures correctness, catches parallel bugs.
