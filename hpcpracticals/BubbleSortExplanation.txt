Purpose of the Code
The code implements a bubble sort algorithm that sorts an array of integers in ascending order. It optimizes performance by:
1. Using sequential bubble sort for small arrays (size ≤ threshold) to avoid parallelization overhead.
2. Using parallel bubble sort with OpenMP for larger arrays to leverage multiple CPU cores.
3. Allowing user input for array size and data (random or manual).
4. Measuring execution time, verifying correctness, and reporting time complexity.

The code demonstrates efficient use of parallel processing, dynamic algorithm switching, input validation, and performance measurement.

Code Explanation

1. Headers and Namespace
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <omp.h>
#include <vector>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <ctime>
#include <iomanip>
#include <limits>
#include <chrono>
using namespace std;
```
- Purpose: Includes libraries for I/O, parallel processing, dynamic arrays, random numbers, output formatting, input validation, and high-precision timing.
- Namespace: std avoids prefixing standard library components.

2. Sequential Bubble Sort
```cpp
void bubbleSortSequential(vector<int> &arr) {
    int n = arr.size();
    for(int i = 0; i < n-1; ++i) {
        bool swapped = false;
        for(int j = 0; j < n-i-1; ++j) {
            if(arr[j] > arr[j+1]) {
                swap(arr[j], arr[j+1]);
                swapped = true;
            }
        }
        if(!swapped) break;
    }
}
```
- Purpose: Standard bubble sort for small arrays to avoid parallel overhead.
- How it works: Iterates through the array, compares adjacent elements, and swaps if out of order. Uses swapped flag for early termination.
- Time Complexity: O(n) best case (already sorted), O(n²) average/worst case.
- Why sequential?: Parallelization overhead outweighs benefits for small arrays.

3. Parallel Bubble Sort
```cpp
void bubbleSortParallel(vector<int> &arr) {
    int n = arr.size();
    int threshold = max(100, 50 * omp_get_max_threads());
    if(n <= threshold) {
        bubbleSortSequential(arr);
        return;
    }
    bool swapped = true;
    #pragma omp parallel
    {
        for(int i = 0; i < n && swapped; ++i) {
            swapped = false;
            #pragma omp for reduction(||:swapped)
            for(int j = i % 2; j < n-1; j += 2) {
                if(arr[j] > arr[j+1]) {
                    swap(arr[j], arr[j+1]);
                    swapped = true;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
- Purpose: Parallel bubble sort using OpenMP for larger arrays.
- Key Features:
  - Threshold: Falls back to sequential sort if size ≤ threshold.
  - Parallelization: Uses #pragma omp parallel for thread teams and #pragma omp for to distribute iterations. Odd-even phases (i % 2) reduce data dependencies.
  - Reduction: reduction(||:swapped) ensures thread-safe updates to swapped flag.
  - Early Termination: Stops if no swaps occur.
- Time Complexity: Same as sequential (O(n) best, O(n²) average/worst), but parallelism reduces runtime.
- Why parallel?: Divides work across threads for faster execution on large arrays.

4. Input Validation
```cpp
int getValidInteger(const string& prompt, int minVal, int maxVal) {
    int value;
    cout << prompt;
    while(!(cin >> value) || value < minVal || value > maxVal) {
        cout << "Invalid input. Enter a number between " << minVal << " and " << maxVal << ": ";
        cin.clear();
        cin.ignore(numeric_limits<streamsize>::max(), '\n');
    }
    return value;
}
```
- Purpose: Ensures valid integer input within a range.
- How it works: Prompts user, validates input, clears errors, and discards invalid characters.

5. Time Complexity Reporting
```cpp
void printTimeComplexity(int size, int threshold) {
    cout << "\nTime Complexity Analysis:\n";
    cout << "- Array size: " << size << ", Threshold for sequential sort: " << threshold << "\n";
    if(size <= threshold) {
        cout << "- Using sequential bubble sort\n";
    } else {
        cout << "- Using parallel bubble sort\n";
    }
    cout << "- Best case: O(n) when array is already sorted (n = " << size << ")\n";
    cout << "- Average/Worst case: O(n²) (n = " << size << ")\n";
    cout << "- Note: Parallelism reduces runtime by a factor up to the number of threads, but asymptotic complexity remains the same.\n";
}
```
- Purpose: Summarizes algorithm used and theoretical performance.
- Details: Reports size, threshold, algorithm, and time complexity (O(n) best, O(n²) average/worst).

6. Main Function
- Purpose: Orchestrates program execution.
- Steps:
  1. Input size (1-1,000,000).
  2. Input method: Random (rand() % 100000) or manual with validation.
  3. Threshold: max(100, 50 * omp_get_max_threads()).
  4. Timing: Measures sorting time using chrono.
  5. Sorting: Calls bubbleSortParallel (may use sequential).
  6. Output: Sorting time, sorted array (if size ≤ 10), sorting verification, and time complexity.

Parallel Bubble Sort Time: 0.000003 seconds
Sorted array: [1, 2, 5, 6, 9]
Array is sorted

Time Complexity Analysis:
- Array size: 5, Threshold for sequential sort: 400
- Using sequential bubble sort
- Best case: O(n) when array is already sorted (n = 5)
- Average/Worst case: O(n²) (n = 5)
- Note: Parallelism reduces runtime by a factor up to the number of threads, but asymptotic complexity remains the same.
```

Step-by-Step Analysis
1. Input: Size = 5, manual input: [5, 2, 9, 1, 6].
2. Threshold: 400 (assuming 8 threads: max(100, 50 * 8)).
3. Sorting: Sequential bubble sort used (size 5 ≤ 400). Sorted array: [1, 2, 5, 6, 9].
4. Timing: 0.000003 seconds (fast due to small size and sequential sort).
5. Output: Prints sorted array (size ≤ 10), confirms array is sorted.
6. Time Complexity: Reports sequential sort, O(5) best, O(25) average/worst.

Key Observations
- Correct sorting and verification.
- Sequential sort appropriate for small size.
- Fast execution due to small input.
- Misleading "Parallel Bubble Sort Time" label (sequential used).

Potential Examiner Questions and Answers
